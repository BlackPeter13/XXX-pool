Features
===

#### Optimized pool server
* TCP (stratum-like) protocol for server-push based jobs
  * Compared to old HTTP protocol, this has a higher hash rate, lower network/CPU server load, lower orphan
    block percent, and less error prone
* Support for Cryptonight (Original, Monero v7, Stellite v7), Cryptonight Light (Original, Aeon v7, IPBC) and Cryptonight Heavy (Sumokoin) algorithms.
* IP banning to prevent low-diff share attacks
* Socket flooding detection
* Share trust algorithm to reduce share validation hashing CPU load
* Clustering for vertical scaling
* Ability to configure multiple ports - each with their own difficulty
* Miner login (wallet address) validation
* Workers identification (specify worker name as the password)
* Variable difficulty / share limiter
* Set fixed difficulty on miner client by passing "address" param with "+[difficulty]" postfix
* Modular components for horizontal scaling (pool server, database, stats/API, payment processing, front-end)
* SSL support for both pool and API servers
* RBPPS (PROP) payment system

#### Live statistics API
* Currency network/block difficulty
* Current block height
* Network hashrate
* Pool hashrate
* Each miners' individual stats (hashrate, shares submitted, pending balance, total paid, payout estimate, etc)
* Blocks found (pending, confirmed, and orphaned)
* Historic charts of pool's hashrate, miners count and coin difficulty
* Historic charts of users's hashrate and payments

#### Mined blocks explorer
* Mined blocks table with block status (pending, confirmed, and orphaned)
* Blocks luck (shares/difficulty) statistics
* Universal blocks and transactions explorer based on [chainradar.com](http://chainradar.com)

#### Smart payment processing
* Splintered transactions to deal with max transaction size
* Minimum payment threshold before balance will be paid out
* Minimum denomination for truncating payment amount precision to reduce size/complexity of block transactions
* Prevent "transaction is too big" error with "payments.maxTransactionAmount" option
* Option to enable dynamic transfer fee based on number of payees per transaction and option to have miner pay transfer fee instead of pool owner (applied to dynamic fee only)
* Control transactions priority with config.payments.priority (default: 0).
* Set payment ID on miner client when using "[address].[paymentID]" login
* Integrated payment ID addresses support for Exchanges

#### Admin panel
* Aggregated pool statistics
* Coin daemon & wallet RPC services stability monitoring
* Log files data access
* Users list with detailed statistics

#### Pool stability monitoring
* Detailed logging in process console & log files
* Coin daemon & wallet RPC services stability monitoring
* See logs data from admin panel

#### Extra features
* An easily extendable, responsive, light-weight front-end using API to display data
* Onishin's [keepalive function](https://github.com/perl5577/cpuminer-multi/commit/0c8aedb)
* Support for merged mining
* Support for slush mining system (disabled by default)
* E-Mail Notifications on worker connected, disconnected (timeout) or banned (support MailGun, SMTP and Sendmail)
* Telegram channel notifications when a block is unlocked
* Top 10 miners report
* Multilingual user interface

Usage
===

#### Requirements
* Coin daemon(s) (find the coin's repo and build latest version from source)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v11.0+
  * For Ubuntu: 
 ```
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | sudo -E bash
  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
 ```
  * Or use NVM(https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for debian/ubuntu.


* [Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store v2.6+ 
  * For Ubuntu: 
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/redis-server
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install redis-server
 ```
 Dont forget to tune redis-server:
 ```
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo 1024 > /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn
 ```
 Add this lines to your /etc/rc.local and make it executable
 ```
 chmod +x /etc/rc.local
 ```
 
* libssl required for the node-multi-hashing module
  * For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`

* Boost is required for the cryptoforknote-util module
  * For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`
  
* libsodium  
  * For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsodium-dev`


##### Seriously
Those are legitimate requirements. If you use old versions of Node.js or Redis that may come with your system package manager then you will have problems. Follow the linked instructions to get the last stable versions.

[**Redis warning**](http://redis.io/topics/security): It'sa good idea to learn about and understand software that
you are using - a good place to start with redis is [data persistence](http://redis.io/topics/persistence).

**Do not run the pool as root** : create a new user without ssh access to avoid security issues :
```bash
sudo adduser --disabled-password --disabled-login your-user
```
To login with this user : 
```
sudo su - your-user
```

#### 1) Downloading & Installing


Clone the repository and run `npm update` for all the dependencies to be installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZentCashFoundation/cryptonote-nodejs-pool.git pool
cd pool

npm update
```
